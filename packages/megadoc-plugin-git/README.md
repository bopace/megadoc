# git megadoc Plugin

This plugin analyzes a git repository's history to present some useful (and silly) statistics, like recent merge activity, and a repository's _superstars_.

Most of these stats are parsed with the help of [git-log-parser](https://github.com/bendrucker/git-log-parser).

## Configuration

See [Config]().
