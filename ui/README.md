### Public Libraries

These libraries will be available at run-time on the `window` object so that you don't have to bundle them along with your plugin.

- [`window.React`](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [`window.ReactRouter`](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
- [`window._` (lodash)](http://lodash.com/)
